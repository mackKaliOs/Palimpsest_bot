# Palimpsest_bot
GitHub repo scaffold for a “script-writing bot” that can (a) mimic archaic styles and (b) transliterate into historical/occult alphabets (e.g., Theban / “Alphabet of Honorius,” “Celestial” alphabet) while also supporting genuine ancient languages (Latin, Koine/Attic Greek, Coptic) when possible.
